# Worlds Hardest game!

## HOW TO PLAY
Download the repo, go into jarfile folder, run the jarfile called testgame.jar and dont update fxgl as i havent touched this game in years. 
Enjoy my take on the game 

## CONTROLS
You move by using WASD keys. 
## BASICS OF THE GAME :
Dont walk into anything blue!(Includes the edges of the map) If you do, your position resets all the way back to the spawn. 
This game is called worlds hardest game for a reason.
